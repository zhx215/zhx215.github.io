However, recent ice retreat due to climate warming again exposed these black "dead mosses". Radiocarbon dating on these dead mosses could inform us the timing of their deaths, which could be used to reconstruct ice advance chronlogy. We took very long time to dicover and identify "dead mosses" during field work.
